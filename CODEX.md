# Codex Quick Context - Signboard

Start here before opening source files.

- Read `docs/codex/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for architecture, data model, and behavior.
- Read `docs/codex/FILE_STRUCTURE.md` for an annotated map of the repository.
- Treat `app/signboard.js` as generated output; edit the source modules in `app/**` and then run `./buildjs.sh`.
- Skip heavy/generated content unless explicitly needed: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `static/vendor/`, and usually `package-lock.json`.
